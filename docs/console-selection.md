# Console Selection


An accessibility application needs information about the user's selection in the console. To retrieve the current console selection, call the [**GetConsoleSelectionInfo**](getconsoleselectioninfo.md) function. The [**CONSOLE\_SELECTION\_INFO**](console-selection-info-str.md) structure contains information about the selection, such as the anchor, coordinates, and status.
