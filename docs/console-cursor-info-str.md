# CONSOLE\_CURSOR\_INFO structure


Contains information about the console cursor.

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
typedef struct _CONSOLE_CURSOR_INFO {
  DWORD dwSize;
  BOOL  bVisible;
} CONSOLE_CURSOR_INFO, *PCONSOLE_CURSOR_INFO;
```

Members
-------

**dwSize**  
The percentage of the character cell that is filled by the cursor. This value is between 1 and 100. The cursor appearance varies, ranging from completely filling the cell to showing up as a horizontal line at the bottom of the cell.

**Note**  While the **dwSize** value is normally between 1 and 100, under some circumstances a value outside of that range might be returned. For example, if **CursorSize** is set to 0 in the registry, the **dwSize** value returned would be 0.

 

**bVisible**  
The visibility of the cursor. If the cursor is visible, this member is **TRUE**.
