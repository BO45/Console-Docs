# About Consoles


Consoles provide high-level support for simple character-mode applications that interact with the user by using functions that read from standard input and write to standard output or standard error. Consoles also provide sophisticated low-level support that gives direct access to a console's screen buffer and that enables applications to receive extended input information (such as mouse input).
